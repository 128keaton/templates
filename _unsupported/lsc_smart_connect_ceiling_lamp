This device makes use of Realtek chipset, and is therefore unfortunately not supported. Currently the link to the website of Action is dead for some reason.

## Modification to ESP8266

The LSC Pir works with tasmota but tasmota didnt boot up fast enough and all settings must be done in the flash file. The PIR only fires up a signal to give power to the ESP. Cut the traces that come from the pir to give the esp full power and the pir will wake Tasmota from deepsleep.
