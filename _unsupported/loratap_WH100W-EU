There's a listing for a US model [WH100W-US](/loratap_WH100W-US.html) which was successfully Tuya Converted in December 2019 but there is a high possibility it will also have the new chip.

This review sample was provided by LoraTap free of charge!

## Packaging

The switch arrived extremely well packed with screws, some wire and one WAGO 3 wire connector which was a very nice touch.

After the main wires were connected the switch was easily added to the Tuya app. It supports power on/off and timers from the app.

Tuya-Convert, on the other hand, **failed**. After trying the newest development version and the still unmerged PR fixes there was still no success which was puzzling since the US version template submission claimed Tuya-Convert works.

It was time to bring out the screwdrivers and soldering iron. The touch button PCB has the wi-fi module on the underside but it is soldered together with the relay board suing 2.0mm long pin headers. Unsoldering those were proving to be a pain so i simply clipped them hoping to solder in new pin headers.

After detaching the touch PCB and removing the sticker placed on the wi-fi module to prevent shorts when touching the relay PCB I realised why Tuya-Convert was failing. The module is WR3E which has a Realtek chip inside. *Cue sad music*

Unless you can replace the chip with a pin compatible ESP12 or macgyver something with a different board, look elsewhere for a 20A smart switch.

The good new is that the relay board has a 20A 22V relay as claimed, therefore there is a project to use the relay board with some ESP826 module or a D1 mini in the future.
