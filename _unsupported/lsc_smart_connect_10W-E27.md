This device is only sold with new Tuya firmware that is not OTA flashable. The WiFi module is not physically reachable without destroying the bulb. The MAC vendor ID is "Espressif Inc." so the module should be an ESP.

[Possibly flashable in the future if a new flashing solution is found](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert/issues/483).
