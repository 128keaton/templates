1. Initially pair the hub using the Tuya app
2. Flash the hub using a serial connection to the TYWE3S module with a standard Tasmota Image.
3. Set up MQTT
4. Go to the console and issue these commands:

```
Rule1 ON TuyaReceived#CmndData DO var1 %value% ENDON ON TuyaReceived#Cmnd==54 DO Publish BleBridge/tele/command %var1% ENDON
Rule1 1
```

5. Set up Node RED to listen on the BleBridge/tele/command MQTT topic then create a new function to process the messages using this code

```javascript
var inputstr = """"
inputstr = msg.payload.slice(6);
msg.payload = inputstr;
return msg;
```

6. The output code will be something like this. For example for a door or motion sensor
055B010100 - Sensor idle
055B010101 - Sensor triggered
0564020400000064 - Battery level 100% (64 in hex)

For the battery level for example
05 identifies the device number
640204 identifies the DPID
00000064 identifies the data
