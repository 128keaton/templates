This device contains an ESP8266-LM1chip inside, here is the manual : https://fccid.io/2AJK8-LM1/User-Manual/User-Manual-3857005.pdf or at https://usermanual.wiki/Lingan-Intelligent-Technology/LM1
and here is a picture with the pinout https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB10CJJdFGWBuNjy0Fbq6z4sXXa1.jpg

In order to flash you need to solder on temporarily some wires to the following pins :

1 - GND - top right pin
2 - 3v3 - top left pin
3 - UTXD - bottom, 2nd pin from the right - will connect to TXD on the FTDI board
4 - URXD - bottom, 3rd pin from the left - will connect to RXD on the FTDI board
5 - IO0 - left side 3rd pin from the top - used to reset the device

Note, there is a "Reset" button on the device, it's not useful to enter flashing mode, you'll need to connect the 5th cable (IO0) to GND for that.
After that power on the FTDI board and do the flashing as normal.

Note there is no led on the board so you won't see the status, you might be able to use a led strip, in my case it was quite flacky to show the status (sometimes the red color turned on when it was in flashing mode, otherwise none of the colors turned on but the flashing worked correctly)

After flashing make sure to use the following template 
{"NAME":"QS-WIFI-RGBCW","GPIO":[0,0,0,0,0,38,0,0,39,0,0,37,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":34}

Note, i only tested the RGB part, didn't have a strip for Cold or Warm, those might not work with this template, also the reset button is not mapped
