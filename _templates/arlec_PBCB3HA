In order to use the button on the device I set the following in Tasmota console. This also updates MQTT so it will retain the setting. This works well if you use Home assistant or other software that uses MQTT to maintain the state of the device.

```console
Backlog ButtonTopic 1; SetOption1 1;SwitchRetain 1;
```

When the led is on and you press the button the plugs will switch on and the led off. If you press it again the reverse will happen.

Please be aware that all 3 plugs work on the same relay so they all go on or off. You can't control them individually. 

You also need to run this rule in the console.

```console
Rule on button1#state=3 do backlog power 0 endon on button1#state=1 do backlog power 1 endon
```
Enable rule with `Rule 1`


UPDATE: I personally found that using 
```console
'{"NAME":"Arlec Cube","GPIO":[0,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,56,21,0,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18}'
```

It just worked. Press button, led turns on so does relay. Press button again, light turns off so does relay.
I did not have to add any extra config for it to just work. Not sure if this is a change in later firmware. But I didn't need any rules or anything else.
