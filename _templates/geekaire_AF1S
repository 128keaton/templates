1. Install Tasmota Version 7+.
1. Run the command `Backlog TuyaMCU 12,4; TuyaMCU 13,5`
1. Run the command 

```console                 
Rule1 on TuyaReceived#Data=55AA03070005030400010016 do publish2 stat/af1sfan/speed 3,0 endon on TuyaReceived#Data=55AA03070005030400010117 do publish2 stat/af1sfan/speed 3,1 endon on TuyaReceived#Data=55AA03070005030400010218 do publish2 stat/af1sfan/speed 3,2 endon on TuyaReceived#Data=55AA03070005030400010319 do publish2 stat/af1sfan/speed 3,3 endon
Rule1 1
```

1. Add the following to Home Assistant to your FAN section:

```yaml
- platform: mqtt
  name: "Flat Bedroom Fan"
  state_topic: "stat/af1sfan/POWER1"
  command_topic: "cmnd/af1sfan/POWER1"
  oscillation_state_topic: "stat/af1sfan/POWER2" 
  oscillation_command_topic: "cmnd/af1sfan/POWER2"
  speed_state_topic: "stat/af1sfan/speed"
  speed_command_topic: "cmnd/af1sfan/TuyaSend4"
  qos: 0
  payload_on: 'ON'
  payload_off: 'OFF'
  payload_oscillation_on: 'ON'
  payload_oscillation_off: 'OFF'
  payload_low_speed: '3,0'
  payload_medium_speed: '3,1'
  payload_high_speed: '3,3'
  availability_topic: tele/af1sfan/LWT
  payload_available: Online
  payload_not_available: Offline
  speeds:
    - low
    - medium
    - high
```    

Notes:
1. Home Assistant only has one oscilation command/topic per fan.  The example above will allow control of the horizontal direction.  To control the vertical direction, change POWER2 to POWER3.
1. MQTT fans in home assistant only have 3 speeds.  The example above is mapped as follows on the device display: LOW = 1, MED = 2, HIGH = 4

```
