Generic garage door controller, TuyaMCU relay with magnetic reed switch

"SwitchMode":[4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] could use inverted also.

```console
Rule1 on switch2#state=1 do publish2 stat/SW_Garage/POWER2 Open endon on switch2#state=0 do publish2 stat/SW_Garage/POWER2 Closed endon
```
Needs to have POWER topic separated to split out reed switch from relay results. Config might need to be adjusted to have LED work correctly.

fnId=2 is set for dpId=101

fnId=11 is set for dpId=1

fnId=0 is set for dpId=7
