Generic garage door controller, TuyaMCU relay with magnetic reed switch

"SwitchMode":[4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] could use inverted also.

To have POWER topic seperated to split out reed switch from relay results run the following commands (from https://groups.google.com/g/sonoffusers/c/wIjX2sWLJMU/m/CzXrzRNvCAAJ).
Config might need to be adjusted to have LED work correctly.
Don't forget to adjust topics in the new rule to your configuration.
https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Rules/#garage-door-opener has more discussion on required rules.
