This configuration will control and sense the state of 2 garage doors (or similar operating devices)

Supplies:
* ST-DC2 board
* 2 reed switches
* USB power supply
* micro USB cable

This project is controlled by Home Assistant with communications run through a MQTT server. 

To flash the board leads will need to be soldered to 3.3v, RX, TX, Ground, GPIO 4, & GPIO 14. 

Only leads Ground, GPIO 4, & GPIO 14 are needed to operate.

After loading the template enter go to the console enter the following:
'pulseTime1 5'
'pulseTime2 5'
This will cause the relays to turn back off after .5 seconds.

Hook the NO side of the relays to the momentary button on the garage door. Use a reed switch wired between GPIO 4 and ground to signal power 3 and GPIO 14 and ground to signal power 4. 

### Home Assistant

In  configuration.yaml add the following:
```yaml

    state_closed: "ON"
    payload_available: "Online"
    payload_not_available: "Offline"
