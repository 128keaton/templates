## Warning

As of July 2020 this device comes with a Tuya WB3S module which cannot be flashed with Tasmota.     
That module is pin compatible with ESP-12 and can ordered via Ebay. Replace the modul with a hot air gun. All LEDs are usable R,G,B,CW,WW and you can dimm it.

To use the build in IR Receiver connected to GPIO00 as IRrecv (if this cannot be selected under configuration use Tasmota-Sensors.bin) add the following rule via Command Line. 

```console
Rule1 ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F740BF DO power Off ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7C03F DO wakeup ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F700FF DO dimmer + ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7807F DO dimmer - ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F720DF DO color 1 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7A05F DO color 2 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7609F DO color 3 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7E01F DO color 000000FF ENDON
```

Don't forget to enable the rule with 'Rule1 1'!

The IR commands don't look complete but support ON/OFF and RGBW Color changes.
