To use the build in IR Receiver connected to GPIO00 as IRrecv (if this cannot be selected under configuration use Tasmota-Sensors.bin) add the following rule via Command Line. 

```console
Rule1 ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F740BF DO power Off ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7C03F DO wakeup ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F700FF DO dimmer + ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7807F DO dimmer - ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F720DF DO color 1 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7A05F DO color 2 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7609F DO color 3 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7E01F DO color 000000FF ENDON
```

Don't forget to enable the rule with 'Rule1 1'!

The IR commands don't look complete but support ON/OFF and RGBW Color changes.
