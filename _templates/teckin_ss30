The interior design of this device has changed. The ESP is not accessible with just taking the back panel off. The entire PCB must be removed (attached only with screws) in order to access the Tuya Wi-Fi module on the other side of the PCB.

[Tuya-Convert](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert/blob/master/README.md) was still able to flash this revision of the device (i.e., the Tuya firmware had not been upgraded).

Changed GPIO16 from Led3i to Relay5. This allows the USB charging ports to be turned on and off.

Also marketed by Amazon as "Etlephe", slightly different model numbers, same look, same template.

From the unit: 
-  Model SM-SO302
-  FCC ID: 2AJ5F-SM-SO301
