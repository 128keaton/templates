2021May - Do not buy this product - Was able to flash with 5 aligator clips (no soldering) RX/TX/GPIO0 route to PCB edge/pad with labels. 
Gnd/3.3 and be clipped from pins found between chip and regulator. Need triangle screw heads (torex can work).
NOTE however, this product was found to have a hot/neutral reverse issue on the middle and right power outlets. 
This is a design issue on the PCB itself so not a one-off. Unsafe product should not be purchased!
