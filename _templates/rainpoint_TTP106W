Tuya water timer as part of an irrigation kit: RainPoint IK10PW. Runs on USB and four AAA batteries for independent operation. 

Device needs to be powered over USB to have Wi-Fi functionality. If it is only battery powered, the Wi-Fi module will be unpowered but the device will still run the watering cycles with the secondary MCU and stored settings.

Identified by `MCU Product ID: {"p":"2ak7r2culspkc7hx","v":"1.1.1","m":0}`

## Flashing

Steps:

1. Remove battery cover
2. Remove the two screws from the bottom and pry the lid off using the tabs on the opposite side
3. Connect GND and RST pins to disable the MCU
4. Wire RX, TX, GND pins to the serial-to-USB adapter
5. Ground GPIO0 before powering up the device with its built-in USB power

If you have power issues during flashing, disconnect the pump from the PCB at the top leftmost JST connector

## Functions
- dpId 1 = (Type1) pump power on/off
- dpId 102 = (Type2) watering duration (6..1800 seconds)
- dpId 103 = (Type2) watering frequency (1..168 hours)
- dpId 104 = (Type2) remaining watering time
- dpId 105 = (Type5) error report (`0x00` = no error; `0x01` = no water)
- dpId 106 = (Type4) operation status: 2 - manual; 1 - auto; 0 - idle
- dpId 107 = (Type2) next watering event in minutes
- dpId 108 = (Type4) power status: (1 - battery high; 2 - medium; 3 - low; 4 - USB port)
- dpId 109 = (Type1) watering autorun on/off

## Configuration

Please read [TuyaMCU](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/TuyaMCU) article to understand the terminology and configuration process.

Applying the template will configure all the necessary dpId's to their functions

Commands for control in Tasmota:
- `Power1` - Pump on/off
- `Power2` - Autorun watering cycle on/off
- `Timer1` - displays time till next watering
- `TuyaSend2 102,x` - set watering duration
- `TuyaSend2 103,x` - set watering frequency

To display remaining watering time as Timer2 run `TuyaMCU 82,104`
