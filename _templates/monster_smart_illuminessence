Nearly identical to Merkury Innovations MI-EW003-999W LED Strip


Purchased a unit on May the 4th 2021. This one uses a TW03 V2.0 which seems to be based on the WinnerMicro W600.
Doesn't appear to support Tasmota and/or Tuya-Convert. Perhaps old version had a different module or someone swapped in an ESP-12F.
I swapped in an ESP-12F on mine and the template is different as the Monster doesn't have Warm and Cool White LEDs.
Got rid of PWM 4 and 5 and also Button 1 since it's connected to IO-15 which has to be grounded (button pressed) for the ESP to start. I shorted IO-15 to ground.
