Based on a TYWE3S module.

Flashed the device with tuya-convert using the supplied Tasmota firmware.

After applying the template enable dimmer functionality using command:

`TuyaMCU 21,2`

See the following link for alternatives if the above doesn't work: https://tasmota.github.io/docs/#/TuyaMCU?id=dimmers

Set dimmer range to:

`DimmerRange to 0,250`
