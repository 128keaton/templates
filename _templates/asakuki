Flashed with Tuya Convert.

**This device is very similar to "Oil Diffuser 550ML Humidifier", the only difference are a few serial command codes.**

"This device has everything controlled via the MCU. It does not work with Tuya Dimmer module due to additional features and different command values. For the device to be fully supported the  [Tuya driver](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arendst/Tasmota/development/sonoff/xdrv_16_tuyadimmer.ino)  would need a major code rewrite.

I’ve configured some rules to get basic functionality and  [configure](https://gist.github.com/blakadder/807df02fcaf88e2b059e7b8d008c1881)  it in Home Assistant.

Rule2 notes:

Relay1 controls the diffuser: intermittent mode / off (you can change the code to a mode of your choice)

Relay2 controls the device LED: white / off (you can change the codes to a color mode of your choice)

Rule3 notes:

First rule string is required, otherwise your device might not respond to serial commands on reboots.

Fan speed is published to a retained mqtt topic and can be controlled via mqtt command  `cmnd/diffuser/Event high`  or  `low`.

**If you use the device buttons or the remote, the state won’t be recorded in Tasmota and your power states will be out of sync**

```console
Rule2 on power1#state=1 do serialsend5 55AA0006000601010001010E endon on power1#state=0 do serialsend5 55AA0006000501010001000D endon on power2#state=1 do serialsend5 5AA000600050B0100010118 endon on power2#state=0 do serialsend5 55AA000600050B0100010017 endon
