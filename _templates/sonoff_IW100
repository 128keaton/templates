Another great new design by Sonoff! Plug with power monitoring and an additional button that can control the outlet itself or configured in Tasmota to control anything else. The plug uses a Chipsea CS7598 for power monitoring (similiarly to the trusty [S31](sonoff_S31)). The relay is rated to 15A 125V or 10A 250VAC. I can confirm everything is working with 230V and a small load (LED bulb).

The switchplate is removable and is held on only by a few plastic clips. Access to the internals requires unscrewing 4 screws. After removing them we see the main PCB with mains electricty, a wifi daughterboard soldered on to it and the touch pad board connected with a 6 pin header.

## Serial Flashing
Necessary GPIO's are neatly broken out  on bottom left, albeit only on pads. Putting device into flash mode will require soldering a small wire to GND (there's a few available on the board) and connecting it to GPIO0 during boot.

Follow the standard flashing procedure and that's it.
