## Flashing
To have best results with this type of device I strongly recommend compiling a stripped down binary. There's an [unofficial binary](https://github.com/tasmota/install/tree/main/firmware/unofficial), compiled from current development release. Flash at your own risk.

```console
SetOption19 1
SetOption66 1
TuyaMCU 11,8
TuyaMCU 51,20
```

Setting reporting rules: 
```console
Rule1 ON TuyaReceived#cmndData DO Publish KitchenPir/tele/PirSensor %value%_sensor_Triggered ENDON
```

In Home Assistant you can then interpret the values:
Tamper Switch: ‘6801000101’
ReedSwitch triggered: ‘6501000100’
Reed Switch multitrigger ‘6501000101’
Not sure: ‘6601000100’ (is usually combined with reeds switch data i.e. 65010001006601000100)

Battery status indicator: ‘670200040000005F’ (67020004000000xx suspected because it only shows up in traffic when on battery power)

This is usually encaptulated in the return packet as
Command/Data stream/Checksum
Checksum
55AA0005000A 6501000100 6601000100 DD (Powered Sample)
55AA00050017 6501000101 6702000400000064 6601000101 6801000101 28 (Battery Sample)
