Converted with tuya-convert2.  simple RGB pwm.   Purchaces at Aldi.  Still available in some stores (Chatswood $80 original  price 120). The alternate link (from by google)  has a very high price $220).  The manufacture web site also shows just the controller.  It does have a spare output for white, but it's just the blue channel.
