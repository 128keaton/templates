When flashing via serial connection remember to pull the TuyaMCU Reset Pin to ground. It's a HR7P169BFGSF from Easysoft so pin 4 must be connected to ground. Device sends data on DpId 101,105,106,107,108.

- `TuyaSend4 101,0` is for 45 degrees
- `TuyaSend4 101,1` is for 60 degrees 
- `TuyaSend4 101,2` is for 85 degrees 
- `TuyaSend4 101,3` is for 100 degrees
- `TuyaSend4 101,5` is for 100 degrees without holding
- `TuyaSend4 101,6` resets the temperature and puts the kettle into idle.
It is required to send a 101,6 command if you want to switch form one temperature to another. 

The state of the kettle is stored under DpId 106 Datafield
Datafield 1 means kettle removed
Datafield 2 means kettle placed on base
Datafield 3 means heating

The temperature of the water is reported via DpId 105 Datafield (hex!) 

DpId 107 and 108 seem to be related to the holding function of the 101,4 command. But not working at the moment.
