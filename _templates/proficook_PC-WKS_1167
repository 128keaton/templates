When flashing via serial connection remember to pull the TuyaMCU Reset Pin to ground. It's a HR7P169BFGSF from Easysoft so pin 4 must be connected to ground. Device sends data on DpId 101,105,106,107,108.

When flashing using tuya-convert press and hold 45Â°C button for 5 seconds to enter fast flashing mode and follow the normal tuya-convert procedure.

- `TuyaSend4 101,0` is for 45 degrees
- `TuyaSend4 101,1` is for 60 degrees 
- `TuyaSend4 101,2` is for 85 degrees 
- `TuyaSend4 101,3` is for 100 degrees
- `TuyaSend4 101,5` is for 100 degrees without holding
- `TuyaSend4 101,6` resets the temperature and puts the kettle into idle.
It is required to send a 101,6 command if you want to switch form one temperature to another. 

The state of the kettle is stored under DpId 106 Datafield (DpIdData)
- Datafield 01 means kettle removed
- Datafield 02 means kettle placed on base (idle state)
- Datafield 03 means heating
- Datafield 05 means maintaining selected temperature

The temperature of the water is reported via DpId 105 Datafield (hex!) 

DpId 107 and 108 seem to be related to the holding function of the 101,4 command. But not working at the moment.
