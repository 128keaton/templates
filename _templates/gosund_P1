Main device button is used to control the on/off of the USB ports and for that we need to setup a rule, otherwise the button will control the first relay instead.  
  
```
Rule1
  ON Button1#State DO Power4 2 ENDON
```  
And enable it with `Rule1 1`
  
3 analog buttons also need a rule to control the relays, I've used range because the values have been stable.
```
Rule2 
  ON Analog#A0div10<30 DO Power3 2 BREAK 
  ON Analog#A0div10<60 DO Power2 2 BREAK 
  ON Analog#A0div10<80 DO Power1 2 ENDON
```  

Then enable it with `Backlog Rule2 1; Rule2 5`
