Can not figure out how to turn off Dimmer setting for this, since I am using the Tuya Dimmer (54) Base. Seems like the only base that would work. 

Required GPIOs can be found here: https://pasteboard.co/IttGPHf.png

This Switch runs off of the TYWE1S Chip, Documentation from Tuya found here: https://docs.tuya.com/en/hardware/WiFi-module/wifi-e1s-module.html
