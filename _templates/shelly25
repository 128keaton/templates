## Serial Connection

Shelly 2.5 comes with a partially exposed programming/debug header which can be used to flash Tasmota on the device. The following diagram shows the device pinout and power source voltage selection jumper. Connect GPIO0 to GND to put the device into flash mode.

## Use rules to control shutter endpoints

Shelly 2.5 contains energy monitoring. You can use rules to power off the shutter when too much current is drawn at the end point. The below rule will power off both directions when the current becomes more than 500mA.

```
rule on energy#current>0.500 do backlog power1 0; power2 0 endon
rule 1
rule 5
```
