<b>
Some Athom devices come with modified Tasmota which is not entirely compatible with regular releases. To have full compatibility you will have to upgrade to main release version but there is a chance of soft bricking your device.</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  Before upgrading set your device to module 18 so that after the upgrade the device will (potentially) be set to Generic module to avoid clicking relays, flashing lights or button resets after upgrade. Perform upgrade to release version using file upload method with <a href="http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release/tasmota.bin.gz">tasmota.bin.gz</a> or <a href="http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release/tasmota-lite.bin.gz">tasmota-lite.bin.gz</a> or with OTAUrl. <b>DO NOT use tasmota-minimal.bin!</b>. 
  <br>
  <br>
  None of the settings will be retained after the upgrade. You will have to search for Tasmota AP and redo the Wi-Fi and MQTT configuration. Once you've upgraded do <code>Reset 6</code> to erase flash and apply the template!
  <br>
  <br>
  ***WARNING!*** Even if you follow the described upgrade procedure there is a chance of soft bricking your device. In most cases it is possible to restore it using <a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Device-Recovery/#fast-power-cycle-device-recovery">Power Cycle Recovery</a> or, if that fails, with serial flash.
