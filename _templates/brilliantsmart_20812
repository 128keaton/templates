The following options need to be set for the light to function correctly:
```console
Backlog SetOption92 1; LedTable 0; DimmerRange 4,100
```

You can enter them via the console.

Uses the Tuya TYWE2L chip based on ESP8285

There are a few different sizes of this lamp - tested on the 12W 290mm version but should work the same for all.
