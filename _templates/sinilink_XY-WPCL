It is possible to use solid core 24 AWG wires to make the connection without needing to solder them to the Sinilink board, but they may need soldering to a connector for the USB to serial adapter. Alternatively, you can strip some Ethernet Cat5e cable, which has the perfect diameter to fit in this board without soldering.

Switch1 is detached and is used to monitor power status of the PC. It will be discovered as a binary sensor in Home Assistant.
