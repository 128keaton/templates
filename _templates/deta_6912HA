To enable standard (factory) functionality of the Status LED (displaying Wi-Fi Connection Status) add this Rule: 
`Rule1 on system#boot do Backlog LedPower 1; LedState 0; LedPower 1; LedState 8; endon'

This rule enables the status LED when its connected to Wi-Fi, without this rule the default behaviour will result in the Status LED switching on & off every time the Relay is activated.
