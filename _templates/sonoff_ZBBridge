<h3>Support for this device is experimental!!!</h3>

Download latest [tasmota-zbbridge](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/blob/firmware/firmware/tasmota/tasmota-zbbridge.bin) binary built specifically for this device.

Flash Tasmota over serial using the TX/RX/IO0 pads.

When the ESP8266 is flashed with it, configure Wifi, and go to the Tasmota Console. Type:

```console
Backlog Weblog 3; Module 0; Template {"NAME":"Flash ZBBridge","GPIO":[56,208,0,209,21,22,0,0,0,158,0,0,17],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18}
```

Wait for Tasmota to reboot. 

You will have 2 toggle in the WebUI `Toggle 1` and `Toggle 2` in the Web UI.

In the Console, issue command `TCPStart 8888`. You should see `TCP: Starting TCP server on port 8888` message

Now make sure `Toggle 2` is set to `OFF` to force Zigbee module bootloader to Gecko mode. Turn `Toggle 1` to `OFF` then to `ON`. The transition from `OFF` to `ON` reboots the Zigbee module.

You should see (with `Weblog 3` active) something similar to:

```haskell
TCP: from MCU: 0D0A4765636B6F20426F6F74
TCP: from MCU: 6C6F616465722076312E41
TCP: from MCU: 2E330D0A312E2075
TCP: from MCU: 706C6F6164206762
TCP: from MCU: 6C0D0A322E207275
TCP: from MCU: 6E0D0A332E206562
TCP: from MCU: 6C20696E666F0D0A42
TCP: from MCU: 4C203E2000
```

Zigbee module firmware is located in [`Tasmota/tools/fw_zbbridge/`](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/blob/development/tools/fw_zbbridge/). 6.5.5 is for use with [Home Assistant ZHA](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/) and 6.7.6 for [Zigbee2Tasmota](http://tasmota.github.io/docs/Zigbee).

> **Do not use right click "Save as" but click on the desired file then click on "Download"

Use a terminal program with XMODEM support such as [TeraTerm](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/) or [ExtraPuTTY](https://www.extraputty.com/features/xmodem.html) in Windows, [lrzsz](https://www.ohse.de/uwe/software/lrzsz.html) or minicom on Linux . Use XMODEM protocol (*make sure telnet/TCP is used not SSH*) to send the file to the IP address of the ZbBridge using port **8888**.

> **There's an ongoing effort to support firmware upload using Tasmota webUI**

Console will display many `TCP: from MCU: ...` messages until the Zigbee firmware upload is complete.

Apply the template

```json
{"NAME":"Sonoff ZbBridge","GPIO":[56,165,0,166,215,0,0,0,0,158,0,0,17],"FLAG":0,"BASE":75}
```

or set `module 75`
