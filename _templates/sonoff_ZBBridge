<h3>Support for this device is experimental!!!</h3>

Download latest [tasmota-zbbridge](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/blob/firmware/firmware/tasmota/tasmota-zbbridge.bin) binary built specifically for ZBBridge.

Flash Tasmota over serial using the TX/RX/IO0 pads.

![ZBBridge pinout](/assets/images/sonoff_ZBBridge_pinout.jpg)

When the ESP8266 chip is flashed with Tasmota, configure Wifi and go to Tasmota Console. Type:

```console
Backlog Weblog 3; so65 1; Module 0; Template {"NAME":"Sonoff ZbBridge","GPIO":[56,165,0,166,215,0,0,0,0,158,0,0,17],"FLAG":0,"BASE":75}
```

Wait for Tasmota to reboot. 

Open the webUI again, go to **Firmware Upgrade** and next to the "Upgrade by file upload" box use the browse button and select Zigbee module firmware you want to flash. 


Zigbee module firmware is located in [`Tasmota/tools/fw_zbbridge/`](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/blob/development/tools/fw_zbbridge/). 6.5.5 is for use with [Home Assistant ZHA](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/) and 6.7.6 for [Zigbee2Tasmota](http://tasmota.github.io/docs/Zigbee).

> **Do not use right click "Save as" but click on the desired file then click on "Download"**

Be patient and wait for a few minutes until flashing is complete. Tasmota will reboot once it is and the console will show Zigbee2Tasmota starting. Follow further instructions depending on your chosen use method.

## For Tasmota
After `ncp-uart-sw_6.7.6_115200.ota` is flashed set `Module 75` or apply the template:


```json
{"NAME":"Sonoff ZbBridge","GPIO":[56,165,0,166,215,0,0,0,0,158,0,0,17],"FLAG":0,"BASE":75}
```


Follow [Zigbee](http://tasmota.github.io/docs/Zigbee) instructions for pairing and managing your devices

## For Home Assistant ZHA
After `ncp-uart-sw_6.5.5_115200.ota` is flashed apply the template

```json
{"NAME":"ZHA ZBBridge","GPIO":[56,208,0,209,59,58,0,0,0,0,0,0,17],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18}
```

Create a rule in Tasmota to start TCPBridge on boot
```console
Rule1 ON System#Boot do TCPStart 8888 endon
```

You can change `8888` to a port you prefer.

Enable rule with `Rule1 1`

In Home Assistant ZHA integration select "Enter Manually" for serial port, "EZSP" as Radio Type and under port setting enter `socket://[your_ip]:8888` (or your port number if changed) and it should be discovered.
