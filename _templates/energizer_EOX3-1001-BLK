I was able to tuya-convert this plug (with a printed date code on the product label of 06/2019), but it seemed to take a few more tries than the other Energizer plugs I've worked with.  I'm not sure if there was a specific button press combination that finally allowed it to connect and flash OTA, but it did eventually work.

There is both a red (GPIO5) and a blue (GPIO4)  LED on this device; both are inverted, but I can't seem to get the template to use them differently, so only red is used in the template.
