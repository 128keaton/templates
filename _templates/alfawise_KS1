## Usage
In the console observe output when IR command is received.

Example:
```console
00:00:51 RSL: tele/tasmota_4855D2/RESULT = {"Time":"1970-01-01T00:00:51","IrReceived":{"Protocol":"NEC","Bits":32,"Data":"0x000C40BF"}}
```

You can then send that command to be transmitted by the KS1. See [IR Remote Commands](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands/#ir-remote)

Example:
```console
IRsend {"Protocol":"NEC","Bits":32,"Data":"0x000C40BF"}
```
