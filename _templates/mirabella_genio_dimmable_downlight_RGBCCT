Note: This is specifically for the RGB+CCT variant (Can do both RGB and cool to warm white) -- an incorrect template was previously marked as the RGB+CCT version. 
The previous template, now marked as being for the CCT variant is at: https://blakadder.github.io/templates/mirabella_genio_dimmable_downlight_CCT.html
