Successful flash with latest Tuya-convert. Easy access labled pin holes for serial flash also. 

No MCU. 

GPIO16 > diffuser

GPIO14 > fan

PWM1, 2 and 3 on GPIO4, 5 and 15.

GPIO13 > buzzer

Power and set diffusion time LEDs left unassigned as well as 
physical buttons. They are located on a daughter board and it seemed to create issues causing me to have to reflash via serial after becoming inaccessible.
