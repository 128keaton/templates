I don't know whether this is a genuine product or not.  On the outside it looks like a Hyleton 315 and the model is shown as hyleton-315.  Inside the case, though, it indicates hyleton-314, and the GPIO assignments do not correspond to the Hyleton 315.  The internals, and particularly the WiFi module look very similar to the Hyleton 313.

I have converted one of these to Tasmota via serial connection, and one of them with tuya-convert.

The GPIO assignments are: 0 - red led inverted, 2 - blue led inverted, 15 - relay, 13 - button."
