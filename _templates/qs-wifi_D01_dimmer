The Smart WiFi Push-Button Dimmer Module is a white-label product and sold under different brands 
e.g. Moes, MoesHouse MS-105, HomCloud, Malmbergs, TOOGOO,...

Originally it is controlled by Tuya/Smart Life App and therefore Tuya Hack might work (without latest updates).
It's a trailing-edge phase dimmer Art. No. QS-WIFI-D01-TRIAC 
and definitely not TRIAC but Power MOSFET driven for dimmable LED light bulbs, dimmable power supplies, incandescent/halogen bulbs,...

The switch input S is intended for push-button control and detects the mains frequency when the button is pressed.
This makes it a bit special and therefore it requires a script for on/off and hold dimming functions.

To use the script you have to compile Tasmota v6.6.0.2 or higher with Script Editor enabled:
`#undef USE_RULES`
`#define USE_SCRIPT`

then paste it into Tasmota 'Configuration' -> 'Edit script' and set 'script enable'
