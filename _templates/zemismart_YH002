`TuyaMCU 11,7` to move the relay to an uncontrollable dpId. WebUI toggle will have no effect.

Feedback is sent on dpId 3 while the position is controlled using dpId 2. To have both do the following:

`TuyaMCU 21,3` maps the position status to dimmer

```console
Rule1 ON Dimmer#State DO TuyaSend2 2,%value% ENDON
```

Enable the rule with `Rule1 1`. The rule watches for dimmer commands and forwards them to dpId 2 which controls position.

This setup might create some micromovements on reboot or same value dimmer commands!

## Functions
`dpID 1` motor control: `0 = open / 1 = stop / 2 = close / 3 = continue`    
`dpID 2` set position: `0 .. 100`    
`dpID 3` current position: `0 .. 100`   *report only    
`dpID 5` set motor direction: `0 = forward / 1 = back`      
`dpID 7` working state: `0 = opening / 1 = closing` *report only, only appears when using remote   
`dpID 10` error notification: 0x00 = ok / ??? = error`  *report only

## Home Assistant

Error sensor:

Watches dpID 10 and triggers if the value is not 0x00.
