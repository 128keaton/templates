Bought at Autozone, Dahlonega, USA. I could not find a photo on the internet, so I took a [picture of my lightbulb](https://photos.app.goo.gl/H9PVmtT1spCt5opW6). The photo is Public Domain.

Also, other than the [PDF instructions](http://www.premieraccessorygroup.com/admin/tiny_mce/plugins/filemanager/uploads/Bulb_Setup_050219.pdf), I could not find information on their website. I did buy these products at Autozone though, and it has Premier (with the same logo as Premier Accessories) printed on the devices.
