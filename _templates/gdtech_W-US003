Works with Tuya-Convert

---
Update 2020-12-30
Good news:
  Continues to work with Tuya-Convert as of Dec 30, 2020
  Package of four from Amazon.ca
  https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07QMNS78S
  No Branding on Packaging
  Box Says W-US003 "WiFi Smart Plug"
  Proect Insert says "Wi-Fi Smart Socket Mini Plug"
  Device says Model MPV2RQ-US "WiFi Smart Socket"
  Could not locate any FCC ID (but that may be because I am not in FCC-land).
  Sticker on Box says "GDTech WiFi Mini Plug, S..a and Goolge Home (3Pack)"
  [Note: Sticker and Amazon says 3-Pack, but its 4 in the box]
  4 of 4 flased Tasmota 9.2.0 with Tuya Convert OTA, no issue. 
Bad News:
  Both the product number I ordered 48 hours ago (B07QMNS78S)
  and the original (B07QRWD29N) are now reading "Currently unavailable.
  We don't know when or if this item will be back in stock."
