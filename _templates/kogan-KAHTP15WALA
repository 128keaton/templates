To get this working with MQTTThing, I did some manual config:

Rule1
  on TuyaReceived#DpType2Id4 do Publish tele/%topic%/CURRENTTEMP %value% endon
  on TuyaReceived#DpType1Id1 do Publish stat/%topic%/ACTIVE %value% endon
  on TuyaReceived#DpType2Id3 do Publish stat/%topic%/TARGETTEMP %value% endon

Rule1 1

Rule2
  on Event#setTemperature do TuyaSend2 3,%value% endon
  on Event#setTemperature do Publish stat/%topic%/TARGETTEMP %value% endon
  
Rule2 1
  
Rule3
  on Power1#state=1 do SerialSend5 55aa0001000000 endon
  on Mqtt#Connected do SerialSend5 55aa0001000000 endon
Rule3 1

On HomeBridge (MQTT Thing):

{
            "type": "heaterCooler",
            "name": "Office Heater",
            "url": "http://XXXXXX:1883",
            "logMqtt": true,
            "topics": {
                "getOnline": "tele/office_heater/LWT",
                "getCurrentTemperature": "tele/office_heater/CURRENTTEMP",
                "setHeatingThresholdTemperature": {
                    "topic": "cmnd/office_heater/EVENT",
                    "apply": "return 'setTemperature='+message;"
                },
                "getHeatingThresholdTemperature": "stat/office_heater/TARGETTEMP",
                "getActive": "stat/office_heater/POWER",
                "setActive": "cmnd/office_heater/Power1"
            },
            "minTemperature": 18,
            "maxTemperature": 30,
            "accessory": "mqttthing",
            "restrictHeaterCoolerState": [
                1
            ],
            "currentHeaterCoolerValues": [
                "Off",
                "Idle",
                "On"
            ],
            "targetHeaterCoolerValues": [
                "Off",
                "On"
            ]
        }

Not done yet - but DPid 1 is on/off, 3 is desired temp, 4 is current temp.
