Relays and Status LED are not connected on the same GPIOâ€™s so I have considered them as a Relay and used rules to have them work as one.

```console
Rule1 on power1#state do power3 %value% endon on power2#state do power4 %value% endon on power4#state do power2 %value% endon on power3#state do power1 %value% endon
Rule1 1
```
