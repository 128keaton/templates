There is no add in for the button on the module as it serves as a reset, rather than an on/off switch. 

To make this work with [v1.0 of the ESP-01 Relay](ESP-01S-Relay-v1), you must remove R2 (desolder it or just break it off with a screwdriver) and pull CH_PD high (this is easiest to do with a 10k resistor):
