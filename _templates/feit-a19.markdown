(note BGR color order)

Going by the Differences Description, I believe all of these model names will work with the same template and can be added to the page.

OM60/RGBW/CA/AG, (Amazon)
BPA800/RGBW/AG/2 ([Costco](https://www.costco.com/FEIT-WiFi-Smart-Bulbs-4-pack.product.100417461.html), though the one I bought in store was a 2 pack)
SYW-A19RGBWAGT1 (Also on the bulbs from Costco)
