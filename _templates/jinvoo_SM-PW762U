This device has one relayed socket and two USB power ports controlled by a solid state relay.
This device is based on Tuya wireless module and can be reflashed with TuyaConvert.
Case is glued and forcefully prying can cause appearance damage. 
Plug is soldered directly on the PCB, so you need to desolder them to access the back of the board.

```lua
GPIO4 = ButtonLEDi (used for status/link LED)
GPIO5 = RightLEDi (used for AC socket LED)
GPIO12 = SocketRelay
GPIO13 = Button
GPIO14 = USBPortSSR + LeftLED (the LED on the left is hardwired to the USB port)
```
