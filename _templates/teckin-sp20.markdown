Alternative template 

`{"NAME":"Teckin SP20","GPIO":[57,0,0,131,0,134,0,0,21,17,132,56,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18}`

There is already a template loaded into the sonoff-basic firmware for the Teckin SP20. That firmware was causing my outlet to turn on and off. I also realized that my device looked slightly different that the one pictured on the Amazon page and in this db. I took this to mean the pin assignments were for a different version of the SP20. I went to blakadder's tasmota template db and located a identical looking model made by Waga Life https://blakadder.github.io/templates/waga_CHCZ02MB.html. The template worked perfectly for my device and wanted to share it in case anyone else has the same issue. 

I can share photos of my device or more information if needed. Feel free to contact me on Discord @Joshin#4762
