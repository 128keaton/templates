Please read [TuyaMCU](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/TuyaMCU) article to understand the terminology and configuration process.

## Flashing
To have best results with this type of device I strongly recommend compiling a stripped down binary. There's an [unofficial binary](https://github.com/tasmota/binaries), compiled from current development release. Flash at your own risk.

## Configuration

_If you're using battery power you need to prevent the device from going to sleep by actuating the reed switch constantly (approximately every 5 seconds) during the configuration._

Change device to a TuyaMCU module (or apply the provided template, result is the same)
```console
Module 54
```
Switch the device to battery powered sensor mode (fnId 51):
```console
TuyaMCU 51,21
```
Disable multipress button options to prevent a device reset or Wi-Fi AP config mode, disable Power Cycle recovery, turn on TuyaReceived publish to MQTT and set switchmode to follow instead of toggle
```console
Backlog SetOption1 1; SetOption65 1; SetOption66 1; SwitchMode 1
```

Check with `TuyaMCU` for the following configuration:
```json
 {"TuyaMCU":[{"fnId":11,"dpId":1},{"fnId":51,"dpId":21}]}
```

```console
Rule1 ON TuyaReceived#Data=55AA00050005650100010171 DO publish2 stat/%topic%/STATUS open ENDON ON TuyaReceived#Data=55aa00050005650100010070 DO publish2 stat/%topic%/STATUS close ENDON ON
```

Donâ€™t forget to turn on the rule: `Rule1 1`
