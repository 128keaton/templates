You need to change a few options. This differs from the generic because of the remapped LED channels. Use tasmota-wifiman.bin firmware.

Tested with tasmota 7.0.0.4, works great. Cool white is simulated.

`setoption15 1`   
`setoption17 1`   
`setoption37 30`    

To remap the LED channels. (Blue works without this, but red and green are swapped, and intermediate colours don't work without this command)   
`setoption59 1`"
