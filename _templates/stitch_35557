Can not figure out how to turn off Dimmer setting for this, since I am using the Tuya Dimmer (54) Base. Seems like the only base that would work. 

Required GPIOs can be found here: ![](https://pasteboard.co/ItCTS7L.png)

This Switch runs off of the TYWE1S Chip ([Documentation from Tuya](https://docs.tuya.com/en/hardware/WiFi-module/wifi-e1s-module.html))

**Current issues: Switch will automatically turn off if physically actuated to the ON position while Tuya RX (108) is present on GPIO 13. [A github issue has been opened regarding this](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/issues/6268)**
