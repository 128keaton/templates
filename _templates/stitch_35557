Use the Command "SetOption65 0" to turn off the dimmer functions of the Base Template (54). May require the latest build of Tasmota for this to disable fully

***Troubleshooting***
If your switch is turning itself off after physically turning it on (not through the software), try compiling the most recent version of Tasmota. Some fixes for Tuya switches were added on Aug 23rd 2019.

This Switch runs off of the TYWE1S Chip ([Documentation from Tuya](https://docs.tuya.com/en/hardware/WiFi-module/wifi-e1s-module.html))
