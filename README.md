# Tasmota templates repository
This is an official repository of templates for devices that are flashable with [Tasmota](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota). 
All the devices are submitted by the awesome community built around Tasmota and [Tuya-Convert](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert).

### Contributing
[Add your device](https://blakadder.github.io/templates/new.html) with a simple Google form.

If you've spotted an error or have additional information for a device click on **EDIT ON GITHUB** box to add. 
If it's your first time refer to "[Editing the Documentation and Creating a Pull Request on Github](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/editing-the-documentation-and-creating-a-pull-request-on-github/9573)" for a tutorial (different site but the principle is the same).
